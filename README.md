### What is this Repo

Most people in the MagicMirror Community are aware of [MMM-GoogleMapsTraffic](https://github.com/vicmora/MMM-GoogleMapsTraffic) (props to @vicmora) and how valuable it is to see a map with real-time traffic data. The one thing that I saw was missing is that the map was static, aka you supplied latitude and longitude and that was it. I extended it to support location lookup via the [Google Geocode Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). All the same stuff applies, you need a developer account that has access to the Api.

Out of the box, the module is the exact same as the original, however if you connect it to my other module extension [Isaac's MMM-Voice-Command](https://github.com/isaac2004/MMM-Voice-Commands) to wire up search via speech. More info on that on the other repo.
